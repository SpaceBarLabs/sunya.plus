                </div>
                <p>The world of open-source software is a vast universe of powerful tools. From managing your own news feeds to creating a private library of articles, there’s open-source solution for nearly everything. These tools give you the power to control your data and customize your digital environment. However, this power often comes with a steep learning curve, requiring technical expertise, server management, and constant maintenance.</p>

                <h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">Your Hosted Solution</h3>
                <p>We believe everyone should have access to these tools, not just those with the time and skills to manage a server. Our mission is to bridge that gap. We take the best open-source applications, handle all the complex setup and maintenance, and provide them to you as simple, affordable, and reliable services. You get all the benefits of powerful, community-driven software with none of the hassle.</p>

                <h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">A Commitment to the Community</h3>
                <p>We are not just users of open source; we are participants in its ecosystem. {{ site.name }} is built by <a href="https://spacebarlabs.com" target="_blank">Space Bar Labs</a> on the fantastic work of projects like <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS" target="_blank">FreshRSS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag" target="_blank">Wallabag</a>. To honor their contribution and to help ensure their continued development, we are committed to giving back. <strong>We contribute 10% of our profits directly to the open-source projects that power our services.</strong> When you subscribe to a Pleiades product, you're not just getting a great tool—you're supporting the community that made it possible.</p>
